Files and their purposes:
1. Process-polygons.js
2. Process-polygons-async.js
3. polygon.csv
4. package.json
5. yarn.lock


File number 1, Process-polygons.js, is the main file to run the program.
My node is v6.11.0 and yarn v0.27.5. Yarn is a package manager tool. 
You must have yarn installed, then from command line run "yarn install".

To run the program, cd into the project dir and run "node Process-polygons.js" 
from command line.

The Process-polygons-async.js file has same solution done in different way through 
Async and Promise usage.The first solution is much cleaner and simpler with out 
callback difficulties.
