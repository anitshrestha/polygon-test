Files and their purposes:
1. Process-polygons.js
2. Process-polygons-async.js
3. polygon.csv
4. package.json
5. yarn.lock
6. main.js


File number 6, main.js, is the main file to run the program.
My node is v6.11.0 and yarn v0.27.5. Yarn is a package manager
tool. You must have yarn installed, then from command line run
"yarn install".

To run the program, cd into the project dir and run "node main" 
from command line.

The Process-polygons-async.js file has same solution done in 
different way through.Async and Promise usage.The first solution
is much cleaner and simpler with out callback difficulties.


Happy Coding :)
